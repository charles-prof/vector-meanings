# Bonus Lesson: Hybrid RAG - Fusing Local and World Knowledge

Our application is now highly effective at answering questions based on the documents we provide. But what if the user's question isn't in our documents? How can we handle general knowledge questions about topics like "What is Vite?" or "How do I publish a VS Code extension?"

This is where a **Hybrid RAG** approach becomes incredibly powerful.

## The Best of Both Worlds

A Hybrid RAG system doesn't just rely on one source of information. It generates answers from multiple sources in parallel and presents them to the user, giving them a comprehensive view.

In this lesson, we will upgrade our app to generate two distinct answers for every query:

1.  **Answer from Your Documents (Local RAG):** This is our existing, private, and context-aware answer. It is grounded in the documents you have provided and uses the Chain-of-Thought reasoning we previously implemented. It is trustworthy for your specific knowledge base.

2.  **World Knowledge Answer (General Q&A):** This is a new answer that will be generated by a more powerful, general-purpose language model. This model has been pre-trained on a vast amount of public data and can answer questions about a wide range of topics. It has **no access** to your private documents.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **New `GeneralKnowledgeService`:** We will create a new service that uses a more capable, instruction-tuned model (like `LaMini-Flan-T5-248M`) designed for general question-answering.
2.  **Parallel Execution:** When the user searches, our application will call both the existing `AnswerService` and the new `GeneralKnowledgeService` simultaneously.
3.  **Split UI:** We will update the user interface to display both answers clearly in separate cards, labeled appropriately so the user understands the source of each answer.

This architecture creates a sophisticated tool that leverages both the privacy of local RAG and the power of large, pre-trained models.
